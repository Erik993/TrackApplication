1) Unit Testing the Repository and all methodss in it
The goal of unit testing the repository is to verify that it correctly 
interacts with the Entity Framework Core's DbContext and processes data as expected, 
without hitting an actual SQL database.
* EF Core's in-memory provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory is used



2) Unit Testing the ViewModel
The goal here is to verify the view model's business logic, 
specifically how it uses the repository and manages the state, 
without using the actual repository implementation.

3) Integration Testing 
Integration testing verifies that the full stack components (Repository and the actual EF Core/SQL setup) work together.
Test Structure
Project: Your xUnit Test Project (or a dedicated TrackApplication.IntegrationTests project).
Test Class: EmployeeRepositoryIntegrationTests.cs
Technique: Configure your tests to use a real database.
Option 1 (Recommended): Use the SQLite provider with an actual file-based database that is created and deleted for each test fixture.
Option 2 (Advanced): Use Docker to spin up a temporary SQL Server instance.
